Simple script to transform a virgin Ubuntu 12.10 LTS server into a Cloudstack compatible
KVM host (node).

Works for Cloudstack version 4.0

Standard installation of Ubuntu 12.10 LTS server, with only OpenSSH chosen during installation.

Script resolves several issues and allows to set IP addresses, mainly for simple networking (no VLANs).
